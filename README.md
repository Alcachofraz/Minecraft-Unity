# Minecraft-Unity

A project where I messed around with Unity, to recreate the popular game of Minecraft. Procedural generation techniques were used to achieve some of the features, utilising mainly Perlin Noise techniques.
  
The main features included are:
- 3D Terrain height generation;
- 2D Biome generation (with 3D border smoothing algorithms);
- 3D cave generation;
- 3D ore vein generation;
- Tree/cactus generation;
- Breaking and placing blocks.
